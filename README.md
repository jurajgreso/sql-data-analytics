# SQL Data Analytics

Welcome to the **Data Analytics Project** repository!  

This is a collection of SQL scripts for for data exploration, analytics, and reporting.  
These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more.  
They help quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database.  
Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.  

I have analyzed data in the Gold layer of SQL Server Data Warehouse ([see my DWH Repo](https://github.com/jurajgreso/sql-data-warehouse)).  

I have followed the best practices in data engineering and analytics that I learned from Baraa Khatib Salkini, the Lead Data Engineering, Analytics & AI @Mercedes-Benz AG and YouTube Educator ["DataWithBaraa"](https://www.youtube.com/@datawithbaraa).
